The [xPack Windows Build Tools](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/windows-build-tools-xpack/)
is a standalone Windows binary distribution of
**GNU make** and a few of other tools required by the Eclipse Embedded CDT
(formerly GNU MCU/ARM Eclipse) project, but the binaries can also be used in
generic build environments.

There are binaries for **x64 Windows**.

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

<Prerequisites/>

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/{{appLcName}}@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack {{appName}}** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack Windows Build Tools uses programs from other projects.

The current version is based on:

- [GNU make](https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/make/), version {frontMatter.make_version} from {frontMatter.make_release_date}
- [Busybox](https://github.com/rmyorston/busybox-w32), the {frontMatter.busybox_tag}
tag from {frontMatter.busybox_date}.

## Changes

There are no functional changes from original projects.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- none

## Shared libraries

The dependencies are either linked as static libraries or the
DLLs are included, so the binaries should run on any Windows system.

## Documentation

- none

## Build

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/actions/)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit.

Install the package with xpm.

The simple test, consists in starting the binary.

```sh
.../xpack-windows-build-tools-{{releaseVersion}}/bin/make --version
```

A more elaborate test would be to run an Eclipse build.
