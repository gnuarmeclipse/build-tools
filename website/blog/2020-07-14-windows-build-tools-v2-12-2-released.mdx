Version **2.12.2** is a maintenance release; it repacks the same tools from the previous release, but built with the new XBB v3.2 tools.

<!-- truncate -->

<PageMetadata title={frontMatter.seo_title} />

This is the **xPack** distribution of **Windows Build Tools** (formerly part
of the GNU MCU/ARM Eclipse project).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64 and x86).

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

Comprehensive instructions for installing **xPack Windows Build Tools** on different platforms
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack Windows Build Tools uses programs from other projects.

The current version is based on:

- GNU make version 4.2.1-1 from the [MSYS2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/) project
- [Busybox](https://github.com/rmyorston/busybox-w32), the 65ae5b24c commit from Apr 06, 2019.

The binaries were built using the

  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
