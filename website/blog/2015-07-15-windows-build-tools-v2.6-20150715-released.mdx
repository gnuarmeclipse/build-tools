## Improvements

The GNU ARM Eclipse Build Tools v2.6 package includes the **version 4.1 of GNU make** (built from MSYS2 source files), and version **1.24.0-git of BusyBox**, which provides a convenient implementation for sh/rm/echo.

The main change from v2.4 is a patch that allows BusyBox to run correctly on 64-bit Windows systems. Apparently this not only makes usage safer, by avoiding the DLL32 mess, but also slightly improves build performances.
