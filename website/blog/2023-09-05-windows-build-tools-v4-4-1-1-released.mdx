DEPRECATED: Version **4.4.1-1** is a new release of the **xPack Windows Build Tools** package, following the make release.

<!-- truncate -->

<PageMetadata title={frontMatter.seo_title} />

The [xPack Windows Build Tools](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io/windows-build-tools-xpack/)
is a standalone Windows binary distribution of
**GNU make** and a few other tools required by the Eclipse Embedded CDT
(formerly GNU MCU/ARM Eclipse) project, but the binaries can also be used in
generic build environments.

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64 and x86).

## Deprecated

Use v4.4.1-2.

## Download

The binary files are available from <a href={frontMatter.download_url}>GitHub Releases</a>.

## Prerequisites

- x64 Windows: Windows 7 with the Universal C Runtime
  ([UCRT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)),
  Windows 8, Windows 10

## Install

The easiest way to install this specific version, is by using **xpm**:

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools@${frontMatter.version}.${frontMatter.npm_subversion} -verbose
`} </CodeBlock>

The full details of installing the **xPack Windows Build Tools**
can be found in the [Install Guide](/docs/install/).

## Compliance

The xPack Windows Build Tools uses programs from other projects.

The current version is based on:

- [GNU make](https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/make/) version {frontMatter.make_version}
- [Busybox](https://github.com/rmyorston/busybox-w32), the {frontMatter.busybox_commit}
commit from {frontMatter.busybox_date}.

## Changes

There are no functional changes from original projects.

## Bug fixes

- the BusyBox code includes a patch around the UCRT bug that affects spawning
  sub-processes.

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

- starting with mid 2023, BusyBox included a make applet, which is preferred
  to GNU make; unfortunately it does not provides the full functionality
  and most builds fail; this applet was disabled in v4.4.1-2.

## Documentation

- none

## Build

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[Maintainer Info](/docs/maintainer/) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/actions/)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit.

Install the package with xpm.

The simple test, consists in starting the binary.

```sh
.../xpack-windows-build-tools-4.4.1-1/bin/make --version
```

A more elaborate test would be to run an Eclipse build.

```

## Deprecation notices

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit x86 Windows was dropped in 2022.
