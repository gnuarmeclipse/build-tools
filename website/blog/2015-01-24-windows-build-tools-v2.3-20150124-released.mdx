## Improvements

The GNU ARM Eclipse Build Tools v2.3 package includes the **version 4.1 of GNU make** (built from source files), and version 1.23 of BusyBox, which provides a convenient implementation for sh/rm/echo.

This version makes an explicit use of a POSIX shell, which improves the behaviour of make, by properly processing the POSIX paths generated by Eclipse, including **names containing spaces**.

For those interested in technical details, if **make** does not find a **/bin/sh** in the path, it falls back to using the Microsoft **cmd.exe** when launching sub-processes. As with other Windows implementations, compared to Unix shells, cmd.exe is severely restricted, also impacting the make correct behaviour.

## Setup

For user convenience, an usual Windows setup wizard is provided.

After running the setup, the tools are installed in the `C:\Program Files\GNU ARM Eclipse\Build Tools` folder (for 32-bit machines), or in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU ARM Eclipse\Build Tools` folder (for 64-bit machines).

Be sure you update the C/C++ → Build → Environment to refer to the actual path.

All executables are 32-bit applications, statically linked, so there should be no DLL problems when using them.

## Uninstall

If needed, you can completely remove the package from your system by running the provided uninstall (**build-tools-uninstall.exe**).
