**Windows Build Tools** is a Windows specific package, customised for the requirements of the Eclipse CDT managed build projects. It includes a recent version of **GNU make** and a recent version of **BusyBox**, which provides a convenient implementation for `sh`/`rm`/`echo`.

[GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

**GNU make** is an open source project hosted on
[Savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/make).

[BusyBox](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable.

**BusyBox** is an open source project hosted on
[busybox.net](https://git.busybox.net/busybox/); the xPack distribution uses
the Windows fork hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/rmyorston/busybox-w32)
and maintained by Ron Yorston.
