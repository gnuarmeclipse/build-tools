## Overview

**xPack Windows Build Tools** is a standalone cross-platform (Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux)
binary distribution of Windows Build Tools,
intended for reproducible builds.

<Overview/>

**xPack Windows Build Tools** is an open source project hosted on GitHub as
[`xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack);
it provides the platform specific binaries as
[release assets](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/releases).

In addition to the binary archives and the package metadata,
this project also includes the
[build scripts](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/tree/xpack/scripts).

<UpgradeNotice/>

## Features

All binaries are:

- **self-contained** (include all required libraries)
- **file-system relocatable** (can be installed in any location)
- built on slightly older systems (to make them run on both old and new systems)

<details>
<summary>Compatibility with older systems</summary>

Given that most operating systems maintain significant compatibility
with older versions, building an application on an older system ensures
that the same binary can run on newer versions. Conversely, building an
application on a newer system may utilize library features that are
not available in older versions, making backward compatibility less
feasible.

</details>

## Benefits

The main advantages of using the **xPack Windows Build Tools** are:

- a convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade procedure;
  the same procedure is used for all major
  platforms (**x86_64 Windows**,
  **x86_64 GNU/Linux**,
  **aarch64 GNU/Linux**,
  **armhf GNU/Linux**,
  **x86_64 macOS**,
  **arm64 macOS**)
- multiple versions of the same package can be installed at the same time on
  the same system
- no need to worry about dependent libraries, all are included
- significantly lighter and easier to use than Docker images that provide
  similar functionality and are GNU/Linux centric
- projects can be tied to specific tools versions; this provides a good
  reproducibility, especially useful in **CI/CD** environments.

<Compatibility/>

## Install

The binaries can be installed automatically as **binary xPacks** or manually as
**portable archives**.

The details of installing the **xPack Windows Build Tools** on various platforms are
presented in the
[Install Guide](/docs/install/).
