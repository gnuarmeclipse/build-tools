### Check the latest upstream release

#### GNU Make

The latest releases must have been announced in
GNU Make [releases](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/).

Compare the latest upstream release with the latest xPack
[release](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/releases/).
If necessary, update the triplet, otherwise increase the fourth number,
as below.

#### BusyBox (Windows fork)

The Windows fork of the BusyBox project doesn't have full releases,
but the latest versions
are tagged in the GitHub project
(https://github.com/rmyorston/busybox-w32/tags).

When updating busybox, increase the fourth version number.
