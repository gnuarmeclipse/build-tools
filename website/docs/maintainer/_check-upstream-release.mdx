### Check the latest upstream release

#### make

The **make** releases are available from
https://mirrors.nav.ro/gnu/make/.

Compare the latest upstream release with the current xPack
[release](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools-xpack/releases).
If necessary, update the triplet, otherwise increase the fourth number,
as below.

#### busybox

The busybox doesn't have full releases, but the latest versions
are tagged in the GitHub project
(https://github.com/rmyorston/busybox-w32/tags).

When updating busybox, increase the fourth version number.
