<HistoryGnuArmEclipse date="December 2014"/>

Originally developed for Unix environments, the **Eclipse CDT** managed build
generator required `make` and `rm`, which are unfortunately not available
on Windows.

Some cross-toolchains for Windows addressed this issue by including
`make` and `rm` in their distribution. However, many did not, leaving
users to find alternative distributions of these tools.

The **GNU Arm Eclipse** plug-ins aimed to enhance path management
by offering a mechanism to define separate paths for the toolchain
and these tools. This led to the creation of the **Windows Build Tools**
project.

The package was first published on `npmjs.com` as
[`@gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gnu-mcu-eclipse/windows-build-tools).

### December 2014

The initial release ([v2.0](/blog/2014/12/02/windows-build-tools-v2.0-20141202-released/))
repackaged the `cs-make.exe` and `cs-rm.exe` binaries, renaming them without the prefix, and bundled them into a `*-setup.exe`.
The binaries were _borrowed_ from
the **[Mentor Sourcery CodeBench Lite](http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/sourcery-tools/sourcery-codebench/editions/lite-edition/)** toolchain for Windows.

### January 2015

The project moved away from the initial Mentor binaries
and started to pack newer versions of `make.exe` and `sh.exe`, built from
sources (in [v2.1](/blog/2015/01/21/windows-build-tools-v2.1-20150121-released/)).
